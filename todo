ufixed and fixed don't desugar yet. Don't we need to add desugar for ufixed and fixed in order to talk about size?

does the twos complement number still have the same bits of memory? or N+1 bits?

why does address immediately desugar? Shouldn't we keep the information that it's an address?

rule #width( intword ( N ) ) => N
rule #width( ufixedword ( N , M ) ) => N
rule #width( fixedword ( N , M ) ) => N

rule #width( bool ) => 1 // bools have 1 byte
rule #width( address ) => 20

rule #width( bytes ( N ) ) => N
